# Highlights (expected)

* The economic potential for renewable energy is vastly larger than future demand.
* System cost of fully-renewable energy system close to a system with current share of nuclear.
* Autarkic system requires substantial storage, likely much less when connected to EUR (which we do not model).

# Introduction

* Ukraine’s electricity system needs to be rebuilt and expanded to cover future demand.
* Situation before the war...
* Current plans of the government...
* Opportunities for renewables including in cooperation with EU...
* Systems approach is necessary which we do here: We are analysing different options for Ukraine's future, fully-electrified energy supply.

# Methods

We are using PyPSA-Eur [@Horsch:2018] to model Ukraine's electrictiy supply. Its main assumptions about individual technologies are shown in @tbl:assumptions. The depreciation rate is set to 7%.

We are using a fully-electrified energy demand time series generated by DESSTINEE [@Oreggioni:2022]. The demand is a projection for the year 2050 (@fig:load). Assumptions are to be disclosed.

For now, we run two scenarios. In the first scenario, `only-renewables`, electricity is generated exclusively from renewables: solar, wind, hydro, and biomass. The lion's share of generation stems from solar and wind.

In the second scenario, `nuclear-and-renewables`, in addition to renewables, electricity can be generated from nuclear. We set the minimal level of nuclear to its pre-war level (~50%).

The main remaining issues are:

1. Add a resource constraint on biomass.
2. Update load time series (the current is preliminary).
3. If possible: Add an uncertainty analysis.

# Results (preliminary)

System cost of renewable only scenario is low (<70 €/MWh, @tbl:lcoe). Keeping nuclear at pre-war's levels shows roughly the same cost (@tbl:lcoe).

Meeting future electricity demand requires a substantial expansion of generation capacities in both scenarios (@tbl:capacities-power).

A fully-autarkic energy system requires substantial amounts of storage capacities, especially in the renewables only scenario (@tbl:capacities-energy).

A fully-renewable energy system uses large amounts of biomass (@tbl:generation).

# Discussion

Both scenarios require large amounts of new generation and storage capacities. Given that biomass fuel is currently not constrained in the model, we can assume that storage capacities will increase even further once biomass fuel is constrained. However, we can also assume that storage capacities can decrease strongly with connecting Ukraine to neighbouring countries.

While required generation and storage capacities are large, there is no reason to believe these capacities could not be built. Ukraine can be powered by only renewables in the future at cost similar to a energy supply including nuclear.
