# Introduction

We are analysing different options for Ukraine's future, fully-electrified energy supply.

# Methods

I am using PyPSA-Eur [@Horsch:2018] to model Ukraine's electrictiy supply. Its main assumptions about individual technologies are shown in @tbl:assumptions. The depreciation rate is set to 7%.

I am using a fully-electrified energy demand time series generated by DESSTINEE [@Oreggioni:2022]. The demand is a projection for the year 2050 (@fig:load). Assumptions are to be disclosed by Iain Staffell.

For now, I run two scenarios. In the first scenario, `only-renewables`, electricity is generated exclusively from renewables: solar, wind, hydro, and biomass. The lion's share of generation stems from solar and wind.

In the second scenario, `nuclear-and-renewables`, in addition to renewables, electricity can be generated from ... coal. It should be nuclear really, but for now the model has an issue with that and so I included coal instead of nuclear. Coal generation has similar technical characteristics but different costs and I will fix this as soon as possible.

The main remaining issues are:

1. Make nuclear work and replace coal with nuclear.
2. Add a resource constraint on biomass.
3. Update load time series (the current is preliminary).

# Results

@tbl:lcoe shows the levelised cost of electricity (including cost of the transmission system), @tbl:capacities-power shows the installed generation capacities in the scenarios, and @tbl:capacities-energy shows the installed storage capacities in the scenarios.

# Discussion

Because projected demand is so much larger than current demand, the two scenarios barely differ. The existing conventional generation capacities are just too small to make a big difference.

Both scenarios require large new amounts of generation and storage capacities. Given that biomass fuel is currently not constrained in the model, we can assume that storage capacities will increase even further once biomass fuel is constrained. However, we can also assume that storage capacities can decrease strongly with connecting Ukraine to neighbouring countries.

While required generation and storage capacities are large, there is no reason to believe these capacities could not be built.
