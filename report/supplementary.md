# Figure S1: Levelised system cost of electricity for both economic growth scenarios

![**Cost breakdown of levelised system cost of electricity.** Cost for scenarios with fully-electrified heat and transport sectors, average cost assumptions, and medium-low and medium-high economic growth assumptions. Storage includes hydrogen, battery, and pumped-hydro storage.](build/results/lcoe-all.png){#fig:lcoe label="S1"}

# Figure S2: Installed capacities for both economic growth scenarios

![**Installed capacities.** Installed **(A)** generation and **(B)** storage capacities of the pre-war electricity system and for scenarios with fully-electrified heat and transport sectors and with average cost assumptions and medium-low and medium-high economic growth assumption.](build/results/capacities-power-all.png){#fig:capacities-power label="S2"}

# Figure S3: Electricity mix for both economic growth scenarios
