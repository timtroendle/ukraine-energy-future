# @fig:time-series-summer: Generation time series for a selected week in summer

![**Generation time series for the week starting 18 June 2012.** The areas show hourly generation of the different components of the energy system. In the low-biomass scenario, available biomass is constrained to 10% of the otherwise assumed value of 513\ TWh/yr. Storage includes hydrogen, battery, and pumped-hydro storage. Storage demand is not shown.](build/results/time-series-summer-zoom.png){#fig:time-series-summer}
