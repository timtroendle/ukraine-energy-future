    The purpose of the work is to elaborate a concept of Roadmap for bioenergy
    development of Ukraine, which outlines the goals and prospects of the
    bioenergy sector until 2050. The proposed Roadmap is an essential document
    for the country for several factors. First, it determines the contribution
    of bioenergy to meeting Ukraine’s international commitments to reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Second,
    the Roadmap shows ways to achieve existing bioenergy development goals until
    2035. Third, the Roadmap can be used to elaborate the National Renewable
    Energy Action Plan until 2030 and the Concept of state policy on energy and
    environment, as well as to revise the Ukraine’s current Energy Strategy with
    an extension until 2050. The baseline approaches of Roadmap for bioenergy
    development of Ukraine until 2050 are in line with the basic principles of
    the Ukrainian Green Deal until 2050 and additionally take into account two
    promising segments of the bioenergy sector such as the development of
    production and consumption of first- and second-generation biofuels and
    biomethane. The structure of consumption of biofuels by their types and by
    types of produced energy carriers is proposed. It is estimated that in 2050,
    about half of the total biofuels consumption will come from solid biofuels
    used for heat production. The rest in comparable proportions will be split
    between solid biofuels for power production, biogas, biomethane, and liquid
    biofuels. Further, the Roadmap needs to be detailed, refined and expanded to
    the level of the Strategy for bioenergy development in Ukraine until 2050.

    Reaching climate stabilisation targets requires strengthening the efforts to
    decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across all final energy uses. The
    European Union (EU) and United Kingdom (UK) have decided to become the first
    climate neutral economic bloc by 2050, with ambitious 2030’s GHG emission
    reduction objectives. National energy and climate plans are currently being
    updated to account for these new targets, considering the role of emerging
    technologies and behavioural changes on emission reductions.Here, the
    DESSTINEE model is used to develop nationally representative energy demand
    scenarios compatible with the transition to net-zero economies. We show that
    country-level final energy consumption per unit of GDP must decrease by
    31–59% across the European Union and the UK by 2050. The wide spread between
    countries stems from different penetration rates for electricity and other
    low carbon vectors within heating, transport, and heavy industries, in
    addition to different paces for efficiency improvement. Outcomes of this
    research are foreseen to contribute to translating emission reduction
    objectives into concrete, sectorial, and geographically disaggregated
    measures and policies; providing significant insights for the design,
    evaluation, and monitoring of climate change mitigation policies.

    Um ihr großes Erneuerbaren-Potenzial zu heben, müsste die Ukraine den von
    Russland besetzten Süden zurückerobern. Dort herrschen die besten
    Windkraftbedingungen. Auf ukrainisch kontrolliertem Terrain bei Odessa plant
    ein deutsches Unternehmen bereits 300 Megawatt. Die Ukraine setzt auf eine
    Einbindung ins EU-Energiesystem.
