    Reaching climate stabilisation targets requires strengthening the efforts to
    decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across all final energy uses. The
    European Union (EU) and United Kingdom (UK) have decided to become the first
    climate neutral economic bloc by 2050, with ambitious 2030’s GHG emission
    reduction objectives. National energy and climate plans are currently being
    updated to account for these new targets, considering the role of emerging
    technologies and behavioural changes on emission reductions.Here, the
    DESSTINEE model is used to develop nationally representative energy demand
    scenarios compatible with the transition to net-zero economies. We show that
    country-level final energy consumption per unit of GDP must decrease by
    31–59% across the European Union and the UK by 2050. The wide spread between
    countries stems from different penetration rates for electricity and other
    low carbon vectors within heating, transport, and heavy industries, in
    addition to different paces for efficiency improvement. Outcomes of this
    research are foreseen to contribute to translating emission reduction
    objectives into concrete, sectorial, and geographically disaggregated
    measures and policies; providing significant insights for the design,
    evaluation, and monitoring of climate change mitigation policies.
