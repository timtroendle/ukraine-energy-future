    Several influential energy systems models (ESMs) indicate that renewable
    energy must supply a large share of the world's electricity to limit global
    temperature increases to 1.5 °C. To better represent the costs and other
    implications of such a transition, it is important that ESMs can
    realistically characterise the technical and economic potential of renewable
    energy resources. This paper presents a Geospatial Information System
    methodology for estimating the global offshore wind energy potential, i.e.
    the terawatt hour per year (TWh/yr) production potential of wind farms,
    assuming capacity could be built across the viable offshore area of each
    country. A bottom-up approach characterises the capacity factors of offshore
    wind farms by estimating the available wind power from high resolution
    global wind speed data sets. Temporal phenomena are retained by binning
    hourly wind speeds into 32 time slices per year considering the wind
    resource across several decades. For 157 countries with a viable offshore
    wind potential, electricity generation potential is produced in tranches
    according to the distance to grid connection, water depth and average annual
    capacity factor. These data can be used as inputs to ESMs and to assess the
    economically viable offshore wind energy potential, on a global or
    per-country basis.

  abstract: "National demand for electricity follows a regular and predictable daily pattern. This pattern is set to change due to efficiency improvements, de-industrialisation and electrification of heat and transport. These changes are independent of renewable infeed and are not well understood: contemporary studies assume that electricity load curves will retain their current shape, scaling equally in all hours. Changes to this shape will profoundly affect the electricity industry: increasing the requirements for flexible and peaking capacity, and reducing asset utilisation and profitability. This paper explores the evolution of load curves to 2050 in Germany and Britain: two countries undergoing radically different energy transformations. It reviews recent developments in Europe's electricity demand, and introduces two models for synthesising future hourly load curves: eLOAD (electricity LOad curve ADjustment) and DESSTinEE (Demand for Energy Services, Supply and Transmission in EuropE). Both models are applied to a decarbonisation scenario for 2050, and consistently show peak loads increasing by about 23% points above the change in annual demand, to 103\_GW in Germany and 92\_GW in Britain. Sensitivities around electrification show that a million extra heat pumps or electric vehicles add up to 1.5\_GW to peak demand. The structure and shape of the future load curves are analysed, and impacts on the national electricity systems are drawn."

    The purpose of the work is to elaborate a concept of Roadmap for bioenergy
    development of Ukraine, which outlines the goals and prospects of the
    bioenergy sector until 2050. The proposed Roadmap is an essential document
    for the country for several factors. First, it determines the contribution
    of bioenergy to meeting Ukraine’s international commitments to reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Second,
    the Roadmap shows ways to achieve existing bioenergy development goals until
    2035. Third, the Roadmap can be used to elaborate the National Renewable
    Energy Action Plan until 2030 and the Concept of state policy on energy and
    environment, as well as to revise the Ukraine’s current Energy Strategy with
    an extension until 2050. The baseline approaches of Roadmap for bioenergy
    development of Ukraine until 2050 are in line with the basic principles of
    the Ukrainian Green Deal until 2050 and additionally take into account two
    promising segments of the bioenergy sector such as the development of
    production and consumption of first- and second-generation biofuels and
    biomethane. The structure of consumption of biofuels by their types and by
    types of produced energy carriers is proposed. It is estimated that in 2050,
    about half of the total biofuels consumption will come from solid biofuels
    used for heat production. The rest in comparable proportions will be split
    between solid biofuels for power production, biogas, biomethane, and liquid
    biofuels. Further, the Roadmap needs to be detailed, refined and expanded to
    the level of the Strategy for bioenergy development in Ukraine until 2050.

  abstract: >-
    Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the
    ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the
    global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new
    reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which
    was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System
    (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade
    of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In
    addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km,
    compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an
    uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal
    resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a
    basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the
    dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available.
    Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with
    respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to
    assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the
    troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy
    data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty
    estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The
    enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of
    weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with
    monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67% to 77%. In general,
    low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa
    downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the
    ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.

  abstract: "The paper provides an assessment of the current wind energy potential in Ukraine, and discusses developmental prospects for wind-hydrogen power generation in the country. Hydrogen utilization is a highly promising option for Ukraine's energy system, environment, and business. In Ukraine, an optimal way towards clean zero-carbon energy production is through the development of the wind-hydrogen sector. In order to make it possible, the energy potential of industrial hydrogen production and use has to be studied thoroughly. Ukraine possesses huge resources for wind energy supply. At the beginning of 2020, the total installed capacity of Ukrainian wind farms was 1.17\_GW. Wind power generation in Ukraine has significant advantages in comparison to the use of traditional sources such as thermal and nuclear energy. In this work, an assessment of the wind resource potential in Ukraine is made via the geographical approach suggested by the authors, and according to the «Methodical guidelines for the assessment of average annual power generation by a wind turbine based on the long-term wind speed observation data». The paper analyses the long-term dynamics of average annual wind speed at 40 Ukrainian weather stations that provide valid data. The parameter for the vertical wind profile model is calculated based on the data reanalysis for 10\_m and 50\_m altitudes. The capacity factor (CF) for modern wind turbine generators is determined. The CF spatial distribution for an average 3\_MW wind turbine and the power generation potential for the wind power plants across the territory of Ukraine are mapped. Based on the wind energy potential assessment, the equivalent possible production of water electrolysis-derived green hydrogen is estimated. The potential average annual production of green hydrogen across the territory of Ukraine is mapped. It is concluded that Ukraine can potentially establish wind power plants with a total capacity of 688\_GW on its territory. The average annual electricity production of this system is supposed to reach up to 2174 bln kWh. Thus, it can provide an average annual production of 483 billion Nm3 (43 million tons) of green hydrogen by electrolysis. The social efficiency of investments in wind-hydrogen electricity is presented."

    Around the world, efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic have profoundly
    changed human activity, which may have improved air quality and reduced
    greenhouse gas emissions. We investigated the impact of the pandemic on
    energy demand and subsequent emissions from electricity and gas throughout
    2020 in the UK. The daily pattern of electricity demand changed in both
    lockdowns, with weekday demand shifting to that of a typical pre-pandemic
    weekend. Energy demand in 2020 was modelled to reveal the impact of the
    weather and the pandemic. The first lockdown reduced demand by 15.6% for
    electricity and 12.0% for commercial gas, whereas the second lockdown
    produced reductions less than half. Domestic gas demand did not change
    during the first lockdown, but increased by 6.1% in the second, likely due
    to increased domestic heat demand. The changes in demand for gas resulted in
    little change to overall gas consumption emissions during the pandemic. For
    electricity, large emission reductions occurred during the two lockdowns: up
    to 22% for CO2, 47% for NO x , and 29% for PM2.5. Yet, the largest CO2
    emission reduction for electricity in 2020 (25%) occurred before the
    pandemic, which happened during a warm and stormy spell with exceptional
    wind generation. These observations suggest that future similar changes in
    activity may result in little change for gas demand and emissions. For
    electricity, emission reductions through changes in energy demand are made
    possible by the generation mix. To enable further emission reductions in the
    future, the generation mix should continue to decarbonise. This will yield
    emission reductions in both times of lowered energy demand, but more
    importantly, during times of high renewable output.

    Reaching climate stabilisation targets requires strengthening the efforts to
    decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across all final energy uses. The
    European Union (EU) and United Kingdom (UK) have decided to become the first
    climate neutral economic bloc by 2050, with ambitious 2030’s GHG emission
    reduction objectives. National energy and climate plans are currently being
    updated to account for these new targets, considering the role of emerging
    technologies and behavioural changes on emission reductions.Here, the
    DESSTINEE model is used to develop nationally representative energy demand
    scenarios compatible with the transition to net-zero economies. We show that
    country-level final energy consumption per unit of GDP must decrease by
    31–59% across the European Union and the UK by 2050. The wide spread between
    countries stems from different penetration rates for electricity and other
    low carbon vectors within heating, transport, and heavy industries, in
    addition to different paces for efficiency improvement. Outcomes of this
    research are foreseen to contribute to translating emission reduction
    objectives into concrete, sectorial, and geographically disaggregated
    measures and policies; providing significant insights for the design,
    evaluation, and monitoring of climate change mitigation policies.

    The parameter importance ranking in the Morris method is based on elementary
    effects calculated at some randomly selected points in the input space. When
    applying this method to a complex dynamic fermentation model, the parameter
    significance ranking was observed to be dependent on the units of the
    factors used in the model hence leading to erroneous ranking results. To
    overcome this problem, this study argues to rank the factors' importance on
    the scaled elementary effects. This solution was shown to correctly identify
    the important factors, thereby improving the resilience of the Morris method
    to type I error (the error committed when the statistical method identifies
    an input parameter as significant when in fact it is not). Overall we
    strongly suggest the use of a non-dimensional measure of elementary effects
    when using the Morris method to ensure a reliable screening of important
    factors in complex models.

    Accurate modelling of the weather’s temporal and spatial impacts on building
    energy demand is critical to decarbonizing energy systems. Here we introduce
    a customizable model for hourly heating and cooling demand applicable
    globally at all spatial scales. We validate against demand from ~5,000
    buildings and 43 regions across four continents. The model requires limited
    data inputs and shows better agreement with measured demand than existing
    models. We use it first to demonstrate that a 1 °C reduction in thermostat
    settings across all buildings could reduce Europe’s gas consumption by
    240 TWh yr−1, approximately one-sixth of historical imports from Russia.
    Second, we show that service demand for cooling is increasing by up to 5%
    per year in some regions due to climate change, and 5 billion people
    experience >100 additional cooling degree days per year when compared with a
    generation ago. The model and underlying data are freely accessible to
    promote further research.

    Predicting future costs of technologies not yet developed is a complex
    exercise that includes many uncertain parameters and functional forms. In
    that context, small modular reactor (SMR) concepts that are in a rather
    early development stage claim to have cost advantages through learning
    effects, standardized design, modularization, co-siting economies, and other
    factors, such as better time-to-market even though they exhibit negative
    economies of scale in their construction costs due to their lower power
    output compared to conventional nuclear reactors. In this paper, we compare
    two different approaches from production theory and show that they have a
    theoretically equal structure. In the second step, we apply these approaches
    to estimate a range of potential construction costs for 15 SMR projects for
    which sufficient data is available. These include water cooled, high
    temperature, and fast neutron spectrum reactors. We then apply the Monte
    Carlo method to benchmark the cost projections assumed by the manufacturers
    by varying the investment costs, the weighted average cost of capital, the
    capacity factor, and the wholesale electricity price in simulations of the
    net present value (NPV) and the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). We
    also test whether the differences between the manufacturer estimates and
    ours differ between technology families of SMR concepts and apply a
    sensitivity analysis. Here we contribute to an intensifying debate in the
    literature on the economics and finance of SMR concepts. The Monte Carlo
    analysis suggests a broad range of NPVs and LCOEs: Surprisingly, the lowest
    LCOE is calculated for a helium-cooled high-temperature reactor, whereas all
    of the light water reactors feature higher LCOEs. None of the tested
    concepts is able to compete economically with existing renewable
    technologies, not even when taking their variability and necessary system
    integration costs into account. The numerical results also confirm the
    importance of the choice of production theory and parameters. We conclude
    that any technology foresight has to take as much of the case specifics into
    account, including technological and institutional specifics; this also
    holds for SMR concepts.

    Background: Energy system optimisation models (ESOMs) are commonly used to
    support long-term planning at national, regional, or continental scales. The
    importance of recognising uncertainty in energy system modelling is
    regularly commented on but there is little practical guidance on how to best
    incorporate existing techniques, such as global sensitivity analysis,
    despite some good applications in the literature.

    Methods: In this paper, we provide comprehensive guidelines for conducting a
    global sensitivity analysis of an ESOM, aiming to remove barriers to
    adopting this approach. With a pedagogical intent, we begin by exploring why
    you should conduct a global sensitivity analysis. We then describe how to
    implement a global sensitivity analysis using the Morris method in an ESOM
    using a sequence of simple illustrative models built using the Open Source
    energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS) framework, followed by a realistic
    example.

    Results: Results show that the global sensitivity analysis identifies
    influential parameters that drive results in the simple and realistic
    models, and identifies uninfluential parameters which can be ignored or
    fixed. We show that global sensitivity analysis can be applied to ESOMs with
    relative ease using freely available open-source tools. The results
    replicate the findings of best-practice studies from the field demonstrating
    the importance of including all parameters in the analysis and avoiding a
    narrow focus on particular parameters such as technology costs.

    Conclusions: The results highlight the benefits of performing a global
    sensitivity analysis for the design of energy system optimisation scenarios.
    We discuss how the results can be interpreted and used to enhance the
    transparency and rigour of energy system modelling studies.
