    As the climate targets tighten and countries are impacted by several crises,
    understanding how and under which conditions carbon dioxide emissions peak
    and start declining is gaining importance. We assess the timing of emissions
    peaks in all major emitters (1965–2019) and the extent to which past
    economic crises have impacted structural drivers of emissions contributing
    to emission peaks. We show that in 26 of 28 countries that have peaked
    emissions, the peak occurred just before or during a recession through the
    combined effect of lower economic growth (1.5 median percentage points per
    year) and decreasing energy and/or carbon intensity (0.7) during and after
    the crisis. In peak-and-decline countries, crises have typically magnified
    pre-existing improvements in structural change. In non-peaking countries,
    economic growth was less affected, and structural change effects were weaker
    or increased emissions. Crises do not automatically trigger peaks but may
    strengthen ongoing decarbonisation trends through several mechanisms.

    Crises may act as tipping points for decarbonization pathways by triggering
    structural economic change or offering windows of opportunity for policy
    change. We investigate both types of effects of the global financial and
    COVID-19 crises on decarbonization in Spain and Germany through a
    quantitative Kaya-decomposition analysis of CO2 emissions and through a
    qualitative review of climate and energy policy changes. We show that the
    global financial crisis resulted in a critical juncture for Spanish CO2
    emissions due to the combined effects of the deep economic recession and
    crisis-induced structural change, resulting in reductions in carbon and
    energy intensities and shifts in the economic structure. However, the crisis
    also resulted in a rollback of renewable energy policy, halting progress in
    the transition to green electricity. The impacts were less pronounced in
    Germany, where pre-existing decarbonization and policy trends continued
    after the crisis. Recovery packages had modest effects, primarily due to
    their temporary nature and the limited share of climate-related spending.
    The direct short-term impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on CO2 emissions were
    more substantial in Spain than in Germany. The policy responses in both
    countries sought to align short-term economic recovery with the long-term
    climate change goals of decarbonization, but it is too soon to observe their
    lasting effects. Our findings show that crises can affect structural change
    and support decarbonization but suggest that such effects depend on
    pre-existing trends, the severity of the crisis and political manoeuvring
    during the crisis. The short-term effects of the Global Financial and
    COVID-19 crises on CO2 emission drivers were larger in Spain than in Germany
    because of pre-existing trends and the crises´ magnitudeThe Global Financial
    Crisis represented a tipping point for emissions in Spain, affecting the
    structural drivers of emissions. However, renewable energy policy was
    temporarily negatively affected by the crisis.Both countries’ policy
    responses to the COVID-19 crisis sought to align short-term economic
    recovery with long-term decarbonization goals, moving beyond the
    ‘environment vs economic recovery’ dichotomy that prevailed during the
    Global Financial Crisis.Green recovery packages should prioritize measures
    with a higher potential to support structural change consistent with deep
    decarbonization.It is crucial to adapt energy and climate policy ex-ante to
    make them more resilient to political and fiscal pressures which may emerge
    in the wake of crises.

    Several influential energy systems models (ESMs) indicate that renewable
    energy must supply a large share of the world's electricity to limit global
    temperature increases to 1.5 °C. To better represent the costs and other
    implications of such a transition, it is important that ESMs can
    realistically characterise the technical and economic potential of renewable
    energy resources. This paper presents a Geospatial Information System
    methodology for estimating the global offshore wind energy potential, i.e.
    the terawatt hour per year (TWh/yr) production potential of wind farms,
    assuming capacity could be built across the viable offshore area of each
    country. A bottom-up approach characterises the capacity factors of offshore
    wind farms by estimating the available wind power from high resolution
    global wind speed data sets. Temporal phenomena are retained by binning
    hourly wind speeds into 32 time slices per year considering the wind
    resource across several decades. For 157 countries with a viable offshore
    wind potential, electricity generation potential is produced in tranches
    according to the distance to grid connection, water depth and average annual
    capacity factor. These data can be used as inputs to ESMs and to assess the
    economically viable offshore wind energy potential, on a global or
    per-country basis.

  abstract: "National demand for electricity follows a regular and predictable daily pattern. This pattern is set to change due to efficiency improvements, de-industrialisation and electrification of heat and transport. These changes are independent of renewable infeed and are not well understood: contemporary studies assume that electricity load curves will retain their current shape, scaling equally in all hours. Changes to this shape will profoundly affect the electricity industry: increasing the requirements for flexible and peaking capacity, and reducing asset utilisation and profitability. This paper explores the evolution of load curves to 2050 in Germany and Britain: two countries undergoing radically different energy transformations. It reviews recent developments in Europe's electricity demand, and introduces two models for synthesising future hourly load curves: eLOAD (electricity LOad curve ADjustment) and DESSTinEE (Demand for Energy Services, Supply and Transmission in EuropE). Both models are applied to a decarbonisation scenario for 2050, and consistently show peak loads increasing by about 23% points above the change in annual demand, to 103\_GW in Germany and 92\_GW in Britain. Sensitivities around electrification show that a million extra heat pumps or electric vehicles add up to 1.5\_GW to peak demand. The structure and shape of the future load curves are analysed, and impacts on the national electricity systems are drawn."

    Multiple energy-related crises require a fast transition towards a
    sustainable energy system. The European Green Deal aims for zero CO2
    emission by 2050, while accelerating climate change impacts obligate a
    faster phase-out of fossil fuels. Energy transition studies for Europe at
    and near 100% renewable energy are used as a benchmark for two newly
    introduced scenarios for Europe reaching zero CO2 emissions by 2050 and
    2040. A technology-rich energy system model was applied in hourly resolution
    for Europe in 20 interconnected regions and in full sector coupling covering
    all energy demands. The results reveal a cost-neutral energy transition
    towards 2050 based on declining levelised cost of electricity and a pathway
    with 9% higher energy costs leading to 17% lower total CO2 emissions with an
    accelerated energy transition by 2040. The two scenarios find shares of
    solar photovoltaic (PV) in total generation of 61%–63% by 2050, the highest
    ever estimated for Europe, still below the highest global average shares
    ranging between 75% and 77% form three independent studies. The central
    energy system components are solar PV, wind power, batteries, electrolysers
    and CO2 direct air capture for carbon capture and utilisation. The core
    characteristic of the European energy future may be best described by a
    power-to-X economy, which may evolve on the global scale to a solar-to-X
    economy.

    Preventing global warming in excess of 1.5°C–2°C requires a transition to
    zero-carbon electricity systems by midcentury along with the widespread
    electrification of other sectors. Current state-level renewable portfolio
    standards and regional transmission arrangements do not capture the benefits
    of inter-regional transmission or coordination of planning and dispatch for
    renewable-energy integration. Here, using a co-optimized capacity-planning
    and dispatch model over 7 years of hourly operation, we show that
    inter-state coordination and transmission expansion reduce the system cost
    of electricity in a 100%-renewable US power system by 46% compared with a
    state-by-state approach, from 135 $/MWh to 73 $/MWh. Sensitivity analyses
    show that reductions in the cost of photovoltaics, wind, and lithium-ion
    batteries lead to the lowest electricity costs for systems in which
    transmission expansion is allowed, while cost reductions for nuclear power
    or long-duration energy storage lead to greater electricity cost reductions
    for isolated systems.

    The development of renewable energy sources (RES) is considered to be a key
    instrument in addressing climate change. However, different RES have
    different potential and economic feasibility depending on country-specific
    conditions and mitigation ambitions. Understanding the relative importance
    of each RES could help policymakers focus their efforts on the most
    promising options. In this paper, we focus on Ukraine and explore the
    potential of biomass use under two mitigation scenarios – with 68% and 83%
    of greenhouse gas emissions reduction in 2050 relative to the 2010 level.
    First, using the TIMES-Ukraine energy system model, we show that biomass
    would play a major role in the future climate mitigation. If constrained at
    the baseline scenario level (due to political or other reasons), mitigation
    costs would be substantially higher – by 14.0–19.6 B € or 10.8–14.3
    €/tCO2-eq., over the 2020–2050 time frame. Second, we quantify the
    importance of each biomass source. We show that woody biomass and bioliquids
    are the most important biofuels under the high-ambition climate scenario,
    while biowaste and bioliquids play a key role in the lower ambition pathway.
    Finally, we analyse the current policy environment in the context of future
    biomass development and conclude with a set of policy recommendations toward
    the realization of the biomass potential in Ukraine. We believe that
    findings presented in the paper would be relevant not only for supporting
    the decision-making process in Ukraine, but could also provide useful
    insights for other countries with similar conditions. © 2021

  title: Transition towards a 100% Renewable Energy System by 2050 for Ukraine

  abstract: >-
    A transition towards a 100% renewable energy (RE) power sector by 2050 is
    investigated for Ukraine. Simulations using an hourly resolved model define
    the roles of storage technologies in a least cost system configuration.
    Results indicate that the levelised cost of electricity will fall from a
    current level of 82 €/MWhe to 60 €/MWhe in 2050 through the adoption of low
    cost RE power generation and improvements in efficiency. If the capacity in
    2050 would have been invested for the cost assumptions of 2050, the cost
    would be 54 €/MWhe, which can be expected for the time beyond 2050. In
    addition, flexibility of and stability in the power system are provided by
    increasing shares of energy storage solutions over time, in parallel with
    expected price decreases in these technologies. Total storage requirements
    include 0-139 GWhe of batteries, 9 GWhe of pumped hydro storage, and
    0-18,840 GWhgas of gas storage for the time period. Outputs of power-to-gas
    begin in 2035 when renewable energy production reaches a share of 86% in the
    power system, increasing to a total of 13 TWhgas in 2050. A 100% RE system
    can be a more economical and efficient solution for Ukraine, one that is
    also compatible with climate change mitigation targets set out at COP21.
    Achieving a sustainable energy system can aid in achieving other political,
    economic and social goals for Ukraine, but this will require overcoming
    several barriers through proper planning and supportive policies.

    Scientific and public controversies about the design of future electricity
    systems can be observed, including differences around centralised and
    decentralised approaches. Taking the German case as an example, we develop a
    typology of (de)centralisation that distinguishes between (1) infrastructure
    location (connectivity and proximity), and (2) infrastructure operation
    (flexibility and controllability). This typology is applied to two competing
    visions for the future of electricity infrastructure. A differentiated view
    of the various dimensions can contribute to the current debate, clarify
    visions for development paths, and inform infrastructure governance.

    The purpose of the work is to elaborate a concept of Roadmap for bioenergy
    development of Ukraine, which outlines the goals and prospects of the
    bioenergy sector until 2050. The proposed Roadmap is an essential document
    for the country for several factors. First, it determines the contribution
    of bioenergy to meeting Ukraine’s international commitments to reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Second,
    the Roadmap shows ways to achieve existing bioenergy development goals until
    2035. Third, the Roadmap can be used to elaborate the National Renewable
    Energy Action Plan until 2030 and the Concept of state policy on energy and
    environment, as well as to revise the Ukraine’s current Energy Strategy with
    an extension until 2050. The baseline approaches of Roadmap for bioenergy
    development of Ukraine until 2050 are in line with the basic principles of
    the Ukrainian Green Deal until 2050 and additionally take into account two
    promising segments of the bioenergy sector such as the development of
    production and consumption of first- and second-generation biofuels and
    biomethane. The structure of consumption of biofuels by their types and by
    types of produced energy carriers is proposed. It is estimated that in 2050,
    about half of the total biofuels consumption will come from solid biofuels
    used for heat production. The rest in comparable proportions will be split
    between solid biofuels for power production, biogas, biomethane, and liquid
    biofuels. Further, the Roadmap needs to be detailed, refined and expanded to
    the level of the Strategy for bioenergy development in Ukraine until 2050.

    Purpose of the article is to identify and analyse ten most important actions
    for Ukraine to completely reject Russian natural gas. The analysis was
    performed taking into account the following basic provisions: territorial
    integrity of Ukraine is within its state as of February 23, 2022; total
    energy consumption is at the level of 2021. Under current conditions,
    Ukraine urgently needs to elaborate and implement an effective and ambitious
    program to refuse Russian natural gas and other fossil fuels imported from
    Russia within several years. Such a program will be much required
    immediately after the end of the military operations at Ukraine’s territory
    and should be a solid basis for energy recovery of the country at the
    post-war period. Taking into account Ukraine’s potential of renewable energy
    sources and other relevant factors, the program must include such important
    actions as replacement of natural gas with biomass and solid biofuels for
    heat production, further construction of wind and solar power plants,
    production of biomethane, introduction of heat pumps, improving energy
    efficiency in district heating (DH) systems, buildings and industry and some
    others. Implementation of these actions will give Ukraine the opportunity to
    reduce the consumption of natural gas and completely replace its imports in
    the amount of up to 10 billion m3/ yr by 2030. Realization of each action
    requires some specific organizational and legislative measures. To a high
    extent, these measures coincide with ones needed to overcome barriers to
    bioenergy development and expansion of district heating in Ukraine.
    Representative examples of the measures are introducing an electronic trade
    system for solid biofuels through electronic auctions; starting auctions for
    the state support of renewable electricity projects; starting auctions for
    load following units and energy storage systems; adopting the National
    Renewable Energy Action Plan until 2030; creating a Register for biomethane;
    introducing competitive heat market in DH systems; introducing incentive
    tariffs for electricity for heat pumps, including the “night” tariffs. ©

    Power sector and energy systems models are widely used to explore the
    impacts of demographic, socio-economic or policy changes on the cost and
    emissions of electricity generation. Technology cost and performance data
    are essential inputs to such models. Despite the ubiquity and importance of
    these parameters, there is no standardised database which collates the
    variety of values from across the literature, so modellers must collect them
    independently each time they populate or update model inputs, leading to
    duplicated efforts and inconsistencies which can profoundly influence model
    results. Technology cost and performance varies between countries, regions
    and over time, meaning that data must be country- or region-specific and
    frequently updated. Values also vary widely between sources, so obtaining a
    broad consensus view is critical. Here, we present a database which collates
    historical, current, and future cost and performance data and assumptions
    for the six most prominent electricity generation technologies; coal, gas,
    hydroelectric, nuclear, solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind power, which
    together accounted for over 92% of installed generation capacity in 2022. In
    addition, we provide the same data for utility-scale battery energy storage
    systems (BESS), regarded as critical to the integration of variable
    renewables such as wind and solar PV. The data are global in scope but with
    regional and national specificity, covers the years 2015 through to 2050,
    and span 5510 datapoints from 56 sources. The database enables modellers to
    select and justify model input data and provides a benchmark for comparing
    assumptions and projections to other sources across the literature to
    validate model inputs and outputs. It is designed to be easily updated with
    new sources of data, ensuring its utility, comprehensiveness, and broad
    applicability in future.

  abstract: >-
    Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the
    ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the
    global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new
    reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which
    was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System
    (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade
    of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In
    addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km,
    compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an
    uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal
    resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a
    basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the
    dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available.
    Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with
    respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to
    assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the
    troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy
    data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty
    estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The
    enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of
    weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with
    monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67% to 77%. In general,
    low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa
    downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the
    ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.

    The implementation of The European Green Deal is a modern driver of changes
    in the energy sector for transition to a clean economy and energy security.
    Access and sustained consumption of clean energy sources, reduction of
    greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution are important
    initiatives for overall socio-economic development. This all implies the
    need to develop models for the analysis the state of the energy system in
    real time as well as predict general energy consumption based on available
    open data and balance databases. In this manuscript, we investigate the
    importance of open data for energy security and the development of effective
    energy policy and institutional frameworks. Analysis of the electrical
    energy balance of Ukraine (the 2019 calendar year) on the base of the open
    data shows the existence of volatility between the production of electricity
    from renewable energy sources and its consumption, which may directly affect
    the country's security.

  abstract: "The paper provides an assessment of the current wind energy potential in Ukraine, and discusses developmental prospects for wind-hydrogen power generation in the country. Hydrogen utilization is a highly promising option for Ukraine's energy system, environment, and business. In Ukraine, an optimal way towards clean zero-carbon energy production is through the development of the wind-hydrogen sector. In order to make it possible, the energy potential of industrial hydrogen production and use has to be studied thoroughly. Ukraine possesses huge resources for wind energy supply. At the beginning of 2020, the total installed capacity of Ukrainian wind farms was 1.17\_GW. Wind power generation in Ukraine has significant advantages in comparison to the use of traditional sources such as thermal and nuclear energy. In this work, an assessment of the wind resource potential in Ukraine is made via the geographical approach suggested by the authors, and according to the «Methodical guidelines for the assessment of average annual power generation by a wind turbine based on the long-term wind speed observation data». The paper analyses the long-term dynamics of average annual wind speed at 40 Ukrainian weather stations that provide valid data. The parameter for the vertical wind profile model is calculated based on the data reanalysis for 10\_m and 50\_m altitudes. The capacity factor (CF) for modern wind turbine generators is determined. The CF spatial distribution for an average 3\_MW wind turbine and the power generation potential for the wind power plants across the territory of Ukraine are mapped. Based on the wind energy potential assessment, the equivalent possible production of water electrolysis-derived green hydrogen is estimated. The potential average annual production of green hydrogen across the territory of Ukraine is mapped. It is concluded that Ukraine can potentially establish wind power plants with a total capacity of 688\_GW on its territory. The average annual electricity production of this system is supposed to reach up to 2174 bln kWh. Thus, it can provide an average annual production of 483 billion Nm3 (43 million tons) of green hydrogen by electrolysis. The social efficiency of investments in wind-hydrogen electricity is presented."

    The paper investigates trends in bioenergy development in Ukraine and its
    role in accelerating the green energy transition in the post-war period. The
    focus of the article is on the use of bioenergy resources for electricity
    generation, heat energy and liquid biofuel production. In this context, the
    potential of biomass, state support mechanisms, the results of their
    influence on bioenergy capacities deployment and the barriers restraining
    this sector development are considered. The study’s results proved that the
    inconsistency of the state policy and the failure to consider the specifics
    of energy production based on various bioenergy resources caused a
    significant lag in its development compared to other renewable energy
    technologies. With this in mind, the article systematizes strengths and
    weaknesses, opportunities and threats, and based on them, strategic
    recommendations for bioenergy development in Ukraine in the post-war period
    are developed. © 2023, Econjournals. All rights reserved.

    Decentralised bioenergy systems are receiving increasing attention due to
    the potential ability to support local development, create local employment,
    and contribute to climate change mitigation. These issues, along with other
    bioenergy sustainability issues, are reviewed through eighteen international
    case studies with the objective of identifying opportunities and threats to
    decentralised bioenergy systems. The case studies were selected based on
    feedstock type, bioenergy type, production capacity, synergistic alliances,
    ownership structure and physical locations. This variation was used to
    provide a basis for evaluating opportunities and threats from different
    contexts. Commercial viability remains the primary concern for the
    sustainability of decentralised bioenergy systems. There are, however,
    opportunities for compounding benefits through integrating small scale
    decentralised bioenergy systems with other production systems. Integrated
    production, including closed loop models, allow waste materials from one
    process to be used as inputs in other production processes, and thereby
    increasing economic, social and environmental outcomes. Synergistic
    opportunities along the bioenergy production chain, which include feedstock
    production, bioenergy marketing and distribution could also be exploited by
    communities and other investors to minimise decentralised production risk.

    Around the world, efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic have profoundly
    changed human activity, which may have improved air quality and reduced
    greenhouse gas emissions. We investigated the impact of the pandemic on
    energy demand and subsequent emissions from electricity and gas throughout
    2020 in the UK. The daily pattern of electricity demand changed in both
    lockdowns, with weekday demand shifting to that of a typical pre-pandemic
    weekend. Energy demand in 2020 was modelled to reveal the impact of the
    weather and the pandemic. The first lockdown reduced demand by 15.6% for
    electricity and 12.0% for commercial gas, whereas the second lockdown
    produced reductions less than half. Domestic gas demand did not change
    during the first lockdown, but increased by 6.1% in the second, likely due
    to increased domestic heat demand. The changes in demand for gas resulted in
    little change to overall gas consumption emissions during the pandemic. For
    electricity, large emission reductions occurred during the two lockdowns: up
    to 22% for CO2, 47% for NO x , and 29% for PM2.5. Yet, the largest CO2
    emission reduction for electricity in 2020 (25%) occurred before the
    pandemic, which happened during a warm and stormy spell with exceptional
    wind generation. These observations suggest that future similar changes in
    activity may result in little change for gas demand and emissions. For
    electricity, emission reductions through changes in energy demand are made
    possible by the generation mix. To enable further emission reductions in the
    future, the generation mix should continue to decarbonise. This will yield
    emission reductions in both times of lowered energy demand, but more
    importantly, during times of high renewable output.

    Reaching climate stabilisation targets requires strengthening the efforts to
    decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across all final energy uses. The
    European Union (EU) and United Kingdom (UK) have decided to become the first
    climate neutral economic bloc by 2050, with ambitious 2030’s GHG emission
    reduction objectives. National energy and climate plans are currently being
    updated to account for these new targets, considering the role of emerging
    technologies and behavioural changes on emission reductions.Here, the
    DESSTINEE model is used to develop nationally representative energy demand
    scenarios compatible with the transition to net-zero economies. We show that
    country-level final energy consumption per unit of GDP must decrease by
    31–59% across the European Union and the UK by 2050. The wide spread between
    countries stems from different penetration rates for electricity and other
    low carbon vectors within heating, transport, and heavy industries, in
    addition to different paces for efficiency improvement. Outcomes of this
    research are foreseen to contribute to translating emission reduction
    objectives into concrete, sectorial, and geographically disaggregated
    measures and policies; providing significant insights for the design,
    evaluation, and monitoring of climate change mitigation policies.

  abstract: "The economy of Ukraine is partially destroyed and poses an energy threat to European countries. The article analyzes trends in the development of consumption in Ukraine, and assesses the prospects for development. Energy Ukraine's system depends on fossil fuels. The government sought to diversify risks and ensure sustainable development. The energy consumption market is characterized by a decline and an increase in the use of gas.  \nThe article develops cases for making decisions on the necessary investments in the energy system of Ukraine after the war. We analyze energy consumption trends and justify the need for investment in the nuclear industry, which occupies a large part of the country's energy consumption. A model for assessing and forecasting the energy consumption market has been developed. The model shows an upward trend in oil and gas consumption. Our approach allows us to quantify the net increase in energy consumption in the future.\_ \nKeywords: energy, energy supply, renewable energy, energy strategy, energy resources"

    <h2>Summary</h2><p>Disagreements persist on how to design a self-sufficient,
    carbon-neutral European energy system. To explore the diversity of design
    options, we develop a high-resolution model of the entire European energy
    system and produce 441 technically feasible system designs that are within
    10% of the optimal economic cost. We show that a wide range of systems based
    on renewable energy are feasible, with no need to import energy from outside
    Europe. Model solutions reveal considerable flexibility in the choice and
    geographical distribution of new infrastructure across the continent.
    Balanced renewable energy supply can be achieved either with or without
    mechanisms such as biofuel use, curtailment, and expansion of the
    electricity network. Trade-offs emerge once specific preferences are
    imposed. Low biofuel use, for example, requires heat electrification and
    controlled vehicle charging. This exploration of the impact of preferences
    on system design options is vital to inform urgent, politically difficult
    decisions for eliminating fossil fuel imports and achieving European carbon
    neutrality.</p>

    The article highlights the key issues of bioenergy development in Ukraine.
    The study found that the role of bioenergy is particularly important, as
    biomass and biofuels can replace traditional fuels and energy sources. For
    Ukraine, bioenergy is one of the strategic directions of development, given
    the country's high dependence on imported energy, primarily natural gas, as
    well as the great potential of biomass available for energy production.
    However, it should be noted that the pace of bioenergy development in
    Ukraine still lags significantly behind European ones. The paper analyzes
    biomass’s place in Ukraine’s energy balance. The potential of biomass for
    energy in Ukraine is assessed and analyzed. The main prospects for the
    development of the bioenergy sector of Ukraine are substantiated. © The

  abstract: >-
    Climate change, limited fossil fuel availability and the dependency on
    energy carrier imports lead the European Union to the formulation of an
    energy policy for Europe. The EU sets the following criteria for its future
    energy supply: sustainability, security of supply and competitiveness.
    Considering the carbon dioxide emissions of fossil fuels and the unsolved
    problem of the ultimate disposal of radioactive waste, only renewable energy
    can currently be considered sustainable if applied in a socially acceptable
    way and in accordance with nature conservation. The use of renewable energy
    can also reduce the dependency on energy carrier imports. Contrary to fossil
    fuels, renewable energy will become cheaper in the future due to
    technological learning. 

    The main disadvantage of some renewable energy resources is their
    fluctuating availability. Adaptation of the energy supply system must take
    place especially in the power sector in order to reliably cover fluctuating
    demand with fluctuating resources at any time. In this work, the energy
    system model ‘REMix’ (Renewable Energy Mix for Sustainable Electricity
    Supply) is developed. It uses data on the availability of renewable energy
    across Europe and North Africa (EUNA) to dimension low-cost power supply
    structures for the EUNA-region, or parts of it, under specific conditions,
    such as specified shares of renewable energy in the power supply or
    specified national self-supply shares. The model takes into account the
    costs of generation technologies, transmission lines and storage units, and
    finds a combination of these technologies and their geographic locations
    that is least-cost under the given assumptions.

    A geographic information system was used for the analysis of the installable
    capacities and power generation potentials of typical technologies for
    harnessing renewable energy resources. This analysis is described and the
    potentials of solar PV, solar CSP, wind onshore and wind offshore, biomass,
    hydro and geothermal power plants are shown in tables and maps. The data are
    used as input into a linear programming energy system model which uses them
    as constraints on the power supply system to be dimensioned. The model, its
    sensitivity to input parameter variations and a test application are
    described. 

    The findings confirm the basic findings of other work in this field:
    transmission lines can be a crucial element of a low-cost,
    renewable-energy-based electricity supply because they enable balancing
    effects in a large grid and the use of the highest quality resources even in
    remote areas, such as deserts or at sea. However, the international
    cooperation that is necessary to reach the cost-minimum for a given supply
    task may not be reached by politics or resulting dependencies may be opposed
    to political goals. Therefore, REMix was built such that countries can be
    examined individually and the influence of different parameters on their
    energy supply costs and structure can be investigated. In the test model
    application, power supply systems for 36 regions in Europe and North Africa,
    almost all individual countries, are designed with REMix as island grids on
    the one hand and on the other hand as a network without transmission
    restrictions (other than the costs of the transmission lines). The model
    shows that in certain regions the island grid electricity costs can be much
    higher than, only a little higher than, or even lower than the electricity
    costs in the network, under the given technological and economic
    assumptions. The sensitivity to parameter variations is shown to be high;
    the results of the test application must therefore be considered one example
    of a technically feasible and efficient supply system but cannot claim to be
    least-cost in general.

    The parameter importance ranking in the Morris method is based on elementary
    effects calculated at some randomly selected points in the input space. When
    applying this method to a complex dynamic fermentation model, the parameter
    significance ranking was observed to be dependent on the units of the
    factors used in the model hence leading to erroneous ranking results. To
    overcome this problem, this study argues to rank the factors' importance on
    the scaled elementary effects. This solution was shown to correctly identify
    the important factors, thereby improving the resilience of the Morris method
    to type I error (the error committed when the statistical method identifies
    an input parameter as significant when in fact it is not). Overall we
    strongly suggest the use of a non-dimensional measure of elementary effects
    when using the Morris method to ensure a reliable screening of important
    factors in complex models.

    Accurate modelling of the weather’s temporal and spatial impacts on building
    energy demand is critical to decarbonizing energy systems. Here we introduce
    a customizable model for hourly heating and cooling demand applicable
    globally at all spatial scales. We validate against demand from ~5,000
    buildings and 43 regions across four continents. The model requires limited
    data inputs and shows better agreement with measured demand than existing
    models. We use it first to demonstrate that a 1 °C reduction in thermostat
    settings across all buildings could reduce Europe’s gas consumption by
    240 TWh yr−1, approximately one-sixth of historical imports from Russia.
    Second, we show that service demand for cooling is increasing by up to 5%
    per year in some regions due to climate change, and 5 billion people
    experience >100 additional cooling degree days per year when compared with a
    generation ago. The model and underlying data are freely accessible to
    promote further research.

    Predicting future costs of technologies not yet developed is a complex
    exercise that includes many uncertain parameters and functional forms. In
    that context, small modular reactor (SMR) concepts that are in a rather
    early development stage claim to have cost advantages through learning
    effects, standardized design, modularization, co-siting economies, and other
    factors, such as better time-to-market even though they exhibit negative
    economies of scale in their construction costs due to their lower power
    output compared to conventional nuclear reactors. In this paper, we compare
    two different approaches from production theory and show that they have a
    theoretically equal structure. In the second step, we apply these approaches
    to estimate a range of potential construction costs for 15 SMR projects for
    which sufficient data is available. These include water cooled, high
    temperature, and fast neutron spectrum reactors. We then apply the Monte
    Carlo method to benchmark the cost projections assumed by the manufacturers
    by varying the investment costs, the weighted average cost of capital, the
    capacity factor, and the wholesale electricity price in simulations of the
    net present value (NPV) and the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). We
    also test whether the differences between the manufacturer estimates and
    ours differ between technology families of SMR concepts and apply a
    sensitivity analysis. Here we contribute to an intensifying debate in the
    literature on the economics and finance of SMR concepts. The Monte Carlo
    analysis suggests a broad range of NPVs and LCOEs: Surprisingly, the lowest
    LCOE is calculated for a helium-cooled high-temperature reactor, whereas all
    of the light water reactors feature higher LCOEs. None of the tested
    concepts is able to compete economically with existing renewable
    technologies, not even when taking their variability and necessary system
    integration costs into account. The numerical results also confirm the
    importance of the choice of production theory and parameters. We conclude
    that any technology foresight has to take as much of the case specifics into
    account, including technological and institutional specifics; this also
    holds for SMR concepts.

    Background: Energy system optimisation models (ESOMs) are commonly used to
    support long-term planning at national, regional, or continental scales. The
    importance of recognising uncertainty in energy system modelling is
    regularly commented on but there is little practical guidance on how to best
    incorporate existing techniques, such as global sensitivity analysis,
    despite some good applications in the literature.

    Methods: In this paper, we provide comprehensive guidelines for conducting a
    global sensitivity analysis of an ESOM, aiming to remove barriers to
    adopting this approach. With a pedagogical intent, we begin by exploring why
    you should conduct a global sensitivity analysis. We then describe how to
    implement a global sensitivity analysis using the Morris method in an ESOM
    using a sequence of simple illustrative models built using the Open Source
    energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS) framework, followed by a realistic
    example.

    Results: Results show that the global sensitivity analysis identifies
    influential parameters that drive results in the simple and realistic
    models, and identifies uninfluential parameters which can be ignored or
    fixed. We show that global sensitivity analysis can be applied to ESOMs with
    relative ease using freely available open-source tools. The results
    replicate the findings of best-practice studies from the field demonstrating
    the importance of including all parameters in the analysis and avoiding a
    narrow focus on particular parameters such as technology costs.

    Conclusions: The results highlight the benefits of performing a global
    sensitivity analysis for the design of energy system optimisation scenarios.
    We discuss how the results can be interpreted and used to enhance the
    transparency and rigour of energy system modelling studies.
