    The purpose of the work is to elaborate a concept of Roadmap for bioenergy
    development of Ukraine, which outlines the goals and prospects of the
    bioenergy sector until 2050. The proposed Roadmap is an essential document
    for the country for several factors. First, it determines the contribution
    of bioenergy to meeting Ukraine’s international commitments to reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Second,
    the Roadmap shows ways to achieve existing bioenergy development goals until
    2035. Third, the Roadmap can be used to elaborate the National Renewable
    Energy Action Plan until 2030 and the Concept of state policy on energy and
    environment, as well as to revise the Ukraine’s current Energy Strategy with
    an extension until 2050. The baseline approaches of Roadmap for bioenergy
    development of Ukraine until 2050 are in line with the basic principles of
    the Ukrainian Green Deal until 2050 and additionally take into account two
    promising segments of the bioenergy sector such as the development of
    production and consumption of first- and second-generation biofuels and
    biomethane. The structure of consumption of biofuels by their types and by
    types of produced energy carriers is proposed. It is estimated that in 2050,
    about half of the total biofuels consumption will come from solid biofuels
    used for heat production. The rest in comparable proportions will be split
    between solid biofuels for power production, biogas, biomethane, and liquid
    biofuels. Further, the Roadmap needs to be detailed, refined and expanded to
    the level of the Strategy for bioenergy development in Ukraine until 2050.

    Reaching climate stabilisation targets requires strengthening the efforts to
    decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across all final energy uses. The
    European Union (EU) and United Kingdom (UK) have decided to become the first
    climate neutral economic bloc by 2050, with ambitious 2030’s GHG emission
    reduction objectives. National energy and climate plans are currently being
    updated to account for these new targets, considering the role of emerging
    technologies and behavioural changes on emission reductions.Here, the
    DESSTINEE model is used to develop nationally representative energy demand
    scenarios compatible with the transition to net-zero economies. We show that
    country-level final energy consumption per unit of GDP must decrease by
    31–59% across the European Union and the UK by 2050. The wide spread between
    countries stems from different penetration rates for electricity and other
    low carbon vectors within heating, transport, and heavy industries, in
    addition to different paces for efficiency improvement. Outcomes of this
    research are foreseen to contribute to translating emission reduction
    objectives into concrete, sectorial, and geographically disaggregated
    measures and policies; providing significant insights for the design,
    evaluation, and monitoring of climate change mitigation policies.

    The parameter importance ranking in the Morris method is based on elementary
    effects calculated at some randomly selected points in the input space. When
    applying this method to a complex dynamic fermentation model, the parameter
    significance ranking was observed to be dependent on the units of the
    factors used in the model hence leading to erroneous ranking results. To
    overcome this problem, this study argues to rank the factors' importance on
    the scaled elementary effects. This solution was shown to correctly identify
    the important factors, thereby improving the resilience of the Morris method
    to type I error (the error committed when the statistical method identifies
    an input parameter as significant when in fact it is not). Overall we
    strongly suggest the use of a non-dimensional measure of elementary effects
    when using the Morris method to ensure a reliable screening of important
    factors in complex models.

    Background: Energy system optimisation models (ESOMs) are commonly used to
    support long-term planning at national, regional, or continental scales. The
    importance of recognising uncertainty in energy system modelling is
    regularly commented on but there is little practical guidance on how to best
    incorporate existing techniques, such as global sensitivity analysis,
    despite some good applications in the literature.

    Methods: In this paper, we provide comprehensive guidelines for conducting a
    global sensitivity analysis of an ESOM, aiming to remove barriers to
    adopting this approach. With a pedagogical intent, we begin by exploring why
    you should conduct a global sensitivity analysis. We then describe how to
    implement a global sensitivity analysis using the Morris method in an ESOM
    using a sequence of simple illustrative models built using the Open Source
    energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS) framework, followed by a realistic
    example.

    Results: Results show that the global sensitivity analysis identifies
    influential parameters that drive results in the simple and realistic
    models, and identifies uninfluential parameters which can be ignored or
    fixed. We show that global sensitivity analysis can be applied to ESOMs with
    relative ease using freely available open-source tools. The results
    replicate the findings of best-practice studies from the field demonstrating
    the importance of including all parameters in the analysis and avoiding a
    narrow focus on particular parameters such as technology costs.

    Conclusions: The results highlight the benefits of performing a global
    sensitivity analysis for the design of energy system optimisation scenarios.
    We discuss how the results can be interpreted and used to enhance the
    transparency and rigour of energy system modelling studies.
