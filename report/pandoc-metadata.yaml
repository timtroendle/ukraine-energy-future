abstract-title: Summary
abstract: |
    Since Russia’s 2022 invasion, Ukraine’s civilian energy infrastructure has faced systematic attack
    and requires urgent and strategic reconstruction. This study confronts the dual challenges of
    rebuilding Ukraine’s energy system rapidly to mitigate civilian and economic disruption while
    aligning this to long-term goals of sustainability and energy security. We demonstrate that Ukraine
    can readily meet future energy demands through a fully renewable electrified system at costs
    comparable to those from fossil fuels and nuclear power. Contrary to previous reliance on
    high-carbon energy sources, we find a diversified renewable energy portfolio, including significant
    solar photovoltaic and wind contributions, can efficiently meet growing energy demands and position
    Ukraine as an energy exporter, leveraging its geographical advantages. The implications of our study
    extend beyond national borders, offering a model for post-conflict reconstruction that harmonizes
    immediate recovery with sustainable energy transition.
